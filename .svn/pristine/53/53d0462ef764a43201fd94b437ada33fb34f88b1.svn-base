Below are the steps to register the dll and execute the class functions.

 

Copy the DLL to your file system (Folder: C:/WINDOWS/MICROSOFT.NET/v2.0.50727) 
Open Command prompt window 
Navigate to C:/WINDOWS/MICROSOFT.NET/v2.0.50727 
Type ‘RegSvcs SystemInfo.dll ’. It will register and add assembly with a warning which can be ignored. 
Open Visual FoxPro 9.0 and execute below lines 
Need to Create Object 
 

oSystemInfo = CreateObject("SystemInfo.SysInformation")

 

Gets the Mac address 
 

? oSystemInfo.GetSystemInformation (“M”)

 

Gets the Processor ID 
 

? oSystemInfo.GetSystemInformation (“P”)

 

Note: Domain user account should have exclusive administrative rights on the system

 

Let me know if you have any further questions.
